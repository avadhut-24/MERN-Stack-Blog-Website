          During Target’s investor event on Tuesday, the retail giant announced it is launching a paid membership program, Target Circle 360, on April
          7 to compete with rivals Amazon and Walmart. The subscription tier includes unlimited free same-day delivery for orders over $35 and two
          free-day shipping, along with other perks like exclusive partnerships and product offerings. The same-day delivery is provided by Target’s
          delivery service Shipt, which the company acquired in 2017.
